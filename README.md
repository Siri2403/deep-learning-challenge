# deep-learning-challenge

Deep learning is a type of artificial intelligence (AI) that uses artificial neural networks to teach computers how to process data and make decisions. It's called "deep" because it uses multiple layers of neural networks, which are algorithms inspired by the human brain.

The summary of this exercise is that the deep learning model was around 73% accurate in predicting the classification problem. Using a model with greater correlation between input and output would likely result in higher prediction accuracy. This could be achieved by doing additional data cleanup up front, as well as by using a model with different activation functions and iterating until higher accuracy is reached.
